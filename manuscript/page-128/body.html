The bag drops from his hands on Petkoff's corns, eliciting a roar of anguish from him.) Begone, you butter-fingered donkey.</p><p>NICOLA (snatching up the bag, and escaping into the house). Yes, sir.</p><p>CATHERINE. Oh, never mind, Paul, don't be angry!</p><p>PETKOFF (muttering). Scoundrel. He's got out of hand while I was away. I'll teach him. (Recollecting his guest.) Oh, well, never mind. Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away. You know very well you're not going back to Switzerland yet.
