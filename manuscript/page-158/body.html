<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>LOUKA. I believe you would rather be my servant than my husband. You would make more out of me. Oh, I know that soul of yours.</p><p>NICOLA (going up close to her for greater emphasis). Never you mind my soul; but just listen to my advice. If you want to be a lady, your present behaviour to me won't do at all, unless when we're alone. </p><p> It's too sharp and impudent; and impudence is a sort of familiarity: it shews affection for me. And don't you try being high and mighty with me either. You're like all country girls: you think it's genteel to treat a servant the way I treat a stable-boy. </p></div> </div>
