Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me.</p><p>MAN. You never saw a cavalry charge, did you?</p><p>RAINA. How could I?</p><p>MAN. Ah, perhaps not—of course. Well, it's a funny sight. It's like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one comes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest in a lump.</p><p>RAINA (her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically). Yes, first One!—the bravest of the brave!</p><p>MAN (prosaically). Hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse.</p></div> </div>
