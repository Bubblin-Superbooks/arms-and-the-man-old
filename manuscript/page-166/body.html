<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Would you dare as much if you loved me? No: if you felt the beginnings of love for me you would not let it grow. You dare not: you would marry a rich man's daughter because you would be afraid of what other people would say of you. </p><p>SERGIUS (carried away). You lie: it is not so, by all the stars! If I loved you, and I were the Czar himself, I would set you on the throne by my side. You know that I love another woman, a woman as high above you as heaven is above earth. And you are jealous of her.</p><p>LOUKA. I have no reason to be. She will never marry you now. The man I told you of has come back. She will marry the Swiss.</p></div> </div>
