Forgive me: I'm too tired to think; and the change of subject was too much for me. Don't scold me.</p><p>RAINA. I forgot. It might make you cry. (He nods, quite seriously. She pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) I must tell you that my father holds the highest command of any Bulgarian in our army. He is (proudly) a Major.</p></div> </div>
