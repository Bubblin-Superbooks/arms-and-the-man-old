Did you spoil any pastry of Miss Raina's this morning?</p><p>NICOLA. You heard Miss Raina say that I did, sir.</p><p>PETKOFF. I know that, you idiot. Was it true?</p><p>NICOLA. I am sure Miss Raina is incapable of saying anything that is not true, sir.</p><p>PETKOFF. Are you? Then I'm not. (Turning to the others.) Come: do you think I don't see it all? (Goes to Sergius, and slaps him on the shoulder.) Sergius: you're the chocolate cream soldier, aren't you?</p></div> </div>
