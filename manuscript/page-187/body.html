They are all very serious and very conscious.) Do you mean to tell me that Raina sends photographic souvenirs to other men?</p><p>SERGIUS (enigmatically). The world is not such an innocent place as we used to think, Petkoff.</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI (rising). It's all right, Major. I'm the chocolate cream soldier. (Petkoff and Sergius are equally astonished.) The gracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams when I was starvingâ€”shall I ever forget their flavour! My late friend Stolz told you the story at Peerot. I was the fugitive.</p><p>PETKOFF. You! (He gasps.) Sergius: do you remember how those two women went on this morning when we mentioned it? (Sergius smiles cynically. Petkoff confronts Raina severely.) You're a nice young woman, aren't you?</p></div> </div>
