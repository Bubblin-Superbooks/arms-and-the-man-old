<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SERGIUS (unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude). Yes: I am a brave man. My heart jumped like a woman's at the first shot; but in the charge I found that I was brave. Yes: that at least is real about me.</p><p>LOUKA. Did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich like you?</p><p>SERGIUS (with bitter levity.) Not a bit. They all slashed and cursed and yelled like heroes. Psha! the courage to rage and kill is cheap. I have an English bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole Bulgarian nation, and the whole Russian nation at its back. </p></div> </div>
