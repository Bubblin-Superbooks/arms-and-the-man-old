<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>CATHERINE. A Swiss? What was he doing in the Servian army?</p><p>PETKOFF. A volunteer of course—keen on picking up his profession. (Chuckling.) We shouldn't have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadn't shewn us how to do it: we knew nothing about it; and neither did the Servians. Egad, there'd have been no war without them.</p><p>RAINA. Are there many Swiss officers in the Servian Army?</p><p>PETKOFF. No—all Austrians, just as our officers were all Russians. This was the only Swiss I came across. I'll never trust a Swiss again. He cheated us—humbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers. They weren't even eatable!</p></div> </div>
