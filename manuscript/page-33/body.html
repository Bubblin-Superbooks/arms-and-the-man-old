If you would like the shutters open, just give them a push like this. (She pushes them: they open: she pulls them to again.)

Good-night.</p><p>LOUKA (carelessly). Good-night. (She goes out, swaggering.)</p><p>(Raina, left alone, goes to the chest of drawers, and adores the portrait there with feelings that are beyond all expression. She does not kiss it or press it to her breast, or shew it any mark of bodily affection; but she takes it in her hands and elevates it like a priestess.)</p></div> </div>
