What's an electric bell?</p><p>CATHERINE. You touch a button; something tinkles in the kitchen; and then Nicola comes up.</p><p>PETKOFF. Why not shout for him?</p><p>CATHERINE. Civilized people never shout for their servants. I've learnt that while you were away.</p><p>PETKOFF. Well, I'll tell you something I've learnt, too. Civilized people don't hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it; so you'd better have all that (indicating the clothes on the bushes) put somewhere else.</p></div> </div>
