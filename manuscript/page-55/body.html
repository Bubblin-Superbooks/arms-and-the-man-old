It's running away with him, of course: do you suppose the fellow wants to get there before the others and be killed? Then they all come. You can tell the young ones by their wildness and their slashing. </p><p>RAINA. Ugh! But I don't believe the first man is a coward. I believe he is a hero!</p><p>MAN (goodhumoredly). That's what you'd have said if you'd seen the first man in the charge to-day.</p><p>RAINA (breathless). Ah, I knew it! Tell me—tell me about him.</p><p>MAN. He did it like an operatic tenor—a regular handsome fellow, with flashing eyes and lovely moustache, shouting a war-cry and charging like Don Quixote at the windmills.</p></div> </div>
