Well, you see, sir, since you say you are half a dozen different gentlemen all at once, I should have a great deal to look after.</p><p>SERGIUS (charmed). Witty as well as pretty.

Gentlefolk are all alikeâ€”you making love to me behind Miss Raina's back, and she doing the same behind yours.</p><p>SERGIUS (recoiling a step). Louka!</p><p>LOUKA. It shews how little you really care!</p><p>SERGIUS (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness).
