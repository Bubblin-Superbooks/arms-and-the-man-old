Leave the shutters so that I can just close them if I hear any noise.</p><p>CATHERINE (authoritatively, turning on her way to the door). Oh, no, dear, you must keep them fastened. You would be sure to drop off to sleep and leave them open. Make them fast, Louka.</p><p>LOUKA. Yes, madam. (She fastens them.)</p><p>RAINA. Don't be anxious about me. The moment I hear a shot, I shall blow out the candles and roll myself up in bed with my ears well covered.</p><p>CATHERINE. Quite the wisest thing you can do, my love. Good-night.</p><p>RAINA. Good-night. (They kiss one another, and Raina's emotion comes back for a moment.) Wish me joy of the happiest night of my lifeâ€”if only there are no fugitives.</p></div> </div>
