<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>NICOLA. Be warned in time, Louka: mend your manners. I know the mistress. She is so grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to her; but if she once suspects that you are defying her, out you go.</p><p>LOUKA. I do defy her. I will defy her. What do I care for her?</p><p>NICOLA. If you quarrel with the family, I never can marry you. It's the same as if you quarrelled with me!</p><p>LOUKA. You take her part against me, do you?</p><p>NICOLA (sedately). I shall always be dependent on the good will of the family. When I leave their service and start a shop in Sofia, their custom will be half my capital: their bad word would ruin me.</p></div> </div>
