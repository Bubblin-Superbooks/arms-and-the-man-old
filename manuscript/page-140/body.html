(He begins to fold and docket the papers. Raina, who has risen from the divan, strolls down the room with her hands clasped behind her, and looks mischievously at him.)</p><p>RAINA. You look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (He looks up, surprised.) What have you done to yourself?</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI. Washed; brushed; good night's sleep and breakfast. That's all.</p><p>RAINA. Did you get back safely that morning?</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI. Quite, thanks.</p><p>RAINA. Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius's charge?</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI. No, they were glad; because they'd all just run away themselves.</p></div> </div>
