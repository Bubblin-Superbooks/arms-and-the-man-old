<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SERGIUS (ironically). Indeed! I am willing to be instructed.</p><p>LOUKA. Look at me! how much am I allowed to have my own will? I have to get your room ready for you—to sweep and dust, to fetch and carry. How could that degrade me if it did not degrade you to have it done for you? But (with subdued passion) if I were Empress of Russia, above everyone in the world, then—ah, then, though according to you I could shew no courage at all; you should see, you should see. </p><p>SERGIUS. What would you do, most noble Empress?</p><p>LOUKA. I would marry the man I loved, which no other queen in Europe has the courage to do. If I loved you, though you would be as far beneath me as I am beneath you, I would dare to be the equal of my inferior. </p></div> </div>
