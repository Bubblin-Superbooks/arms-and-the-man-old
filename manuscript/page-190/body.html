<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>NICOLA (coming forward ). I beg your pardon, sir. There is a mistake. Louka is not engaged to me.</p><p>PETKOFF. Not engaged to you, you scoundrel! Why, you had twenty-five levas from me on the day of your betrothal; and she had that gilt bracelet from Miss Raina.</p><p>NICOLA (with cool unction). We gave it out so, sir. But it was only to give Louka protection. She had a soul above her station; and I have been no more than her confidential servant. I intend, as you know, sir, to set up a shop later on in Sofia; and I look forward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into the nobility. </p></div> </div>
