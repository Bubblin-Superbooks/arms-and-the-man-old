<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>LOUKA. Do you think she would believe the Swiss if he told her now that I am in your arms?</p><p>SERGIUS (releasing her in despair). Damnation! Oh, damnation! Mockery, mockery everywhere: everything I think is mocked by everything I do. (He strikes himself frantically on the breast.) Coward, liar, fool! Shall I kill myself like a man, or live and pretend to laugh at myself? (She again turns to go.) Louka! (She stops near the door.) Remember: you belong to me. </p><p>LOUKA (quietly). What does that meanâ€”an insult?</p><p>SERGIUS (commandingly). It means that you love me, and that I have had you here in my arms, and will perhaps have you there again. Whether that is an insult I neither know nor care: take it as you please. But (vehemently) I will not be a coward and a trifler. </p></div> </div>
