<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SERGIUS (saluting humorously, and then offering his hand with great charm of manner). Welcome, our friend the enemy!</p><p>PETKOFF. No longer the enemy, happily. (Rather anxiously.) I hope you've come as a friend, and not on business.</p><p>CATHERINE. Oh, quite as a friend, Paul. I was just asking Captain Bluntschli to stay to lunch; but he declares he must go at once.</p><p>SERGIUS (sardonically). Impossible, Bluntschli. We want you here badly. We have to send on three cavalry regiments to Phillipopolis; and we don't in the least know how to do it.</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI (suddenly attentive and business-like). Phillipopolis! The forage is the trouble, eh?</p><p>PETKOFF (eagerly). Yes, that's it. (To Sergius.) He sees the whole thing at once.</p></div> </div>
