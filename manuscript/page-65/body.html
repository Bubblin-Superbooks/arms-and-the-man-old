<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MAN (quickly waking up a little). Have your people got that notion?</p><p>RAINA (with dignity). My mother and I can understand that notion, as you call it. And if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in your father's house.</p><p>MAN. Quite sure?</p><p>RAINA (turning her back on him in disgust.) Oh, it is useless to try and make you understand.</p><p>MAN. Don't be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any mistake. My father is a very hospitable man: he keeps six hotels; but I couldn't trust him as far as that. What about YOUR father?</p></div> </div>
