<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>RAINA. I thought you might have remembered the great scene where Ernani, flying from his foes just as you are tonight, takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy, an old Castilian noble. The noble refuses to give him up. His guest is sacred to him.</p><p>MAN (quickly waking up a little). Have your people got that notion?</p><p>RAINA (with dignity). My mother and I can understand that notion, as you call it. And if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in your father's house.</p><p>MAN. Quite sure?</p><p>RAINA (turning her back on him in disgust.) Oh, it is useless to try and make you understand.</p></div> </div>
