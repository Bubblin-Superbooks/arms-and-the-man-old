You owe me an apology. (Sergius immediately, like a repeating clock of which the spring has been touched, begins to fold his arms.)</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI (before he can speak). It's no use. He never apologizes.</p><p>LOUKA. Not to you, his equal and his enemy. To me, his poor servant, he will not refuse to apologize.</p></div> </div>
