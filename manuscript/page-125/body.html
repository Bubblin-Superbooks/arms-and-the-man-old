(She comes down into the centre of the group, between Bluntschli and Petkoff) I made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding; and that stupid Nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it. </p><p>BLUNTSCHLI (laughing). I assure you I did. (Stealing a whimsical glance at her.) Your explanation was a relief.</p><p>PETKOFF (suspiciously, to Raina). And since when, pray, have you taken to cooking?</p><p>CATHERINE. Oh, whilst you were away. It is her latest fancy.</p><p>PETKOFF (testily). And has Nicola taken to drinking? He used to be careful enough. First he shews Captain Bluntschli out here when he knew quite well I was in the—hum!—library; and then he goes downstairs and breaks Raina's chocolate soldier. </p></div> </div>
