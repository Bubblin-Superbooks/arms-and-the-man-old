<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BLUNTSCHLI. True. Allow me. (He takes out his card-case, and stops to write his address, keeping Catherine in an agony of impatience. As he hands her the card, Petkoff, hatless, rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality, followed by Sergius.)</p><p>PETKOFF (as he hurries down the steps). My dear Captain Bluntschli—</p><p>CATHERINE. Oh Heavens! (She sinks on the seat against the wall.)</p><p>PETKOFF (too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes Bluntschli's hand heartily). Those stupid people of mine thought I was out here, instead of in the—haw!—library. (He cannot mention the library without betraying how proud he is of it.) I saw you through the window. </p></div> </div>
