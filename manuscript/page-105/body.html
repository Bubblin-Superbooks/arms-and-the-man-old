(He takes her into the stableyard gateway, where they are hidden from the house.)</p><p>LOUKA (complaining). I may have been seen from the windows: Miss Raina is sure to be spying about after you.</p><p>SERGIUS (stungâ€”letting her go). Take care, Louka. I may be worthless enough to betray the higher love; but do not you insult it.</p><p>LOUKA (demurely). Not for the world, sir, I'm sure. May I go on with my work please, now?</p><p>SERGIUS (again putting his arm round her). You are a provoking little witch, Louka. If you were in love with me, would you spy out of windows on me?</p></div> </div>
