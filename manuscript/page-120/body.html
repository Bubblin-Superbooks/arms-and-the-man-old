If you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with your servant as I pass out, I need detain you no further. (He turns to go into the house.)</p><p>CATHERINE (catching him by the sleeve). Oh, you must not think of going back that way. (Coaxing him across to the stable gates.) This is the shortest way out. Many thanks. So glad to have been of service to you. Good-bye.</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI. But my bag?</p><p>CATHERINE. It will be sent on. You will leave me your address.</p></div> </div>
