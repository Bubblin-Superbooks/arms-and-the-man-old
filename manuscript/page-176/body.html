(She turns away, and throws herself on the divan under the centre window, quite overcome.)</p><p>SERGIUS (cynically). Raina: our romance is shattered. Life's a farce.</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI (to Raina, goodhumoredly). You see: he's found himself out now.</p><p>SERGIUS. Bluntschli: I have allowed you to call me a blockhead. You may now call me a coward as well. I refuse to fight you. Do you know why?</p><p>BLUNTSCHLI. No; but it doesn't matter. I didn't ask the reason when you cried on; and I don't ask the reason now that you cry off. I'm a professional soldier. I fight when I have to, and am very glad to get out of it when I haven't to. </p></div> </div>
