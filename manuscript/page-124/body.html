(Towering over Bluntschli, he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps, Petkoff following. As Bluntschli puts his foot on the first step, Raina comes out of the house.)</p><p>RAINA (completely losing her presence of mind). Oh, the chocolate cream soldier!</p><p>(Bluntschli stands rigid. Sergius, amazed, looks at Raina, then at Petkoff, who looks back at him and then at his wife.)</p><p>CATHERINE (with commanding presence of mind). My dear Raina, don't you see that we have a guest hereâ€”Captain Bluntschli, one of our new Servian friends?</p><p>(Raina bows; Bluntschli bows.)</p></div> </div>
