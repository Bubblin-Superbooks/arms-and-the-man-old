<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MAN (dreamily, lulled by her voice). No, capture only means death; and death is sleep—oh, sleep, sleep, sleep, undisturbed sleep! Climbing down the pipe means doing something—exerting myself—thinking! Death ten times over first.</p><p>RAINA (softly and wonderingly, catching the rhythm of his weariness). Are you so sleepy as that?</p><p>MAN. I've not had two hours' undisturbed sleep since the war began. I'm on the staff: you don't know what that means. I haven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.</p><p>RAINA (desperately). But what am I to do with you.</p><p>MAN (staggering up). Of course I must do something. (He shakes himself; pulls himself together; and speaks with rallied vigour and courage.) You see, sleep or no sleep, hunger or no hunger, tired or not tired, you can always do a thing when you know it must be done. </p></div> </div>
