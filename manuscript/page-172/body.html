<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BLUNTSCHLI. I don't know: he hasn't told me. Better not interfere, dear young lady. No harm will be done: I've often acted as sword instructor. He won't be able to touch me; and I'll not hurt him. </p><p>RAINA (turning away deeply hurt, almost with a sob in her voice). I never said I wanted to see you again.</p><p>SERGIUS (striding forward). Ha! That is a confession.</p><p>RAINA (haughtily). What do you mean?</p><p>SERGIUS. You love that man!</p><p>RAINA (scandalized). Sergius!</p><p>SERGIUS. You allow him to make love to you behind my back, just as you accept me as your affianced husband behind his. Bluntschli: you knew our relations; and you deceived me. It is for that that I call you to account, not for having received favours that I never enjoyed.</p></div> </div>
